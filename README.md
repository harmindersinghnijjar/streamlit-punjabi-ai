Streamlit code for Speech to Text and Text to Speech conversion. The code uses the Speech Recognition and Google Translate libraries to convert the speech to text in Gurmukhi and then translate it to English. Then, the OpenAI library generates the response to the user's question. Finally, the Narakeet API turns the response into audio and plays it.
