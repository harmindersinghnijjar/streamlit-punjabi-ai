A Streamlit app programmed in Python, this text-to-speech conversational AI for Punjabi uses the OpenAI library to generate responses to user input. The VLC module reads out the response in Punjabi, while the PyAudio and Wave libraries record user input and transcribe it using the Speech-to-Text API.
